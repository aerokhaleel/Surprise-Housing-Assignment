## General Information
- Goal to predict housing price from dataset.
- Surprise is an investor to analysis market value for housing price for buying and selling to the public
- Required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables.
- This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables
-CSV file used

## Conclusions
- Both Lasso and Ridge Regression, will giving likely same r2 values.
- It is better to use Lasso, since Lasso shrinks the coefficient estmates towards Zero and perfrom variable selection.
- Advise to use simple but robust model.
- Positive and Negative predictor variables influence for increase/decrease in sale price of house.

## Technologies Used
- Pandas
- sklearn
- seaborn
